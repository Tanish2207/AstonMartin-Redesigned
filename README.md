**Project Documentation**

- **Aim:**
- Despite the vast array of car brands available, consumers often struggle to find comprehensive and reliable information about each brand's offerings, features, and specifications. This lack of centralized and user-friendly resources results in a fragmented search experience, leading to frustration and decision-making challenges for potential car buyers.
- Our solution is to create a comprehensive car brand website that centralizes detailed information about various automotive brands, their models, features, specifications, reviews, and comparisons. By offering a user-friendly interface and regularly updating content.
- **Theory:**
- We employed a combination of React.js, HTML, CSS, and GSAP (Green Sock Animation Platform) to develop lifelike 3D car models. By harnessing GSAP's powerful animation capabilities within the React framework, we achieved fluid motion and realistic visual effects, enhancing the overall user experience and creating dynamic interactions with our 3D car models.
  - **Software Requirement:** 1. Front End - React JS.
    - Back End - MongoDB and ExpressJS.
    - 3D animations using React three fiber and GSAP.
  - **Hardware Requirement:** Laptop.
- Using 3D animation, we'll showcase the Aston Martin Vantage, highlighting its sleek exterior design, powerful engine, luxurious interior, and advanced technological features. Through dynamic animations, viewers will experience the car's aerodynamic contours, signature grille, premium upholstery, cutting-edge infotainment system, and high-performance capabilities, providing an immersive exploration of its key features and attributes.
- Also, for User’s ease we have added an option of TEST DRIVE with which the user will be able to know more about the handling of the car, also it is distributed in steps for the sake of convinience. Through this the user will get enough information about the overall handling.
